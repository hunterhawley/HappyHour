HappyHour makes natural social interactions possible online.

# Inspiration
As the COVID-19 pandemic got started, I became quickly frustrated by the lack of online tools available for organizing social gatherings (multiple conversations happening simultaniously vs. Zoom-style one speaker at a time). I built this simple webpage as a proof-of-concept to see if you could "overhear" other conversations while still staying locked in on your own. Others have since run with similar ideas, and since this wasn't something that I was passionate enough to pursue seriously, I am making the repo public. Hopefully something like this (actually functional though, of course) comes to production soon!
